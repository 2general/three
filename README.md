Three
=====

An updated [Open311 API](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2) Python wrapper
that was built to be as absolute user-friendly and easy-to-use as
possible.


Installation
------------

This is still a work in progress, but you can `git clone` this repo and
run `python setup.py install` to check out the current progress.


Usage
-----

If you have an Open311 API key that you always intend to use, rather
than initializing the `Three` class with it each time, you can set an
`OPEN311_API_KEY` environment variable on the command line.

    export OPEN311_API_KEY="MY_API_KEY"
